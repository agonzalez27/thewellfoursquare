            Jesus loved kids! He was extremely clear when there were those who tried to keep them from getting to Him. In Luke 18:16-17, He said, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” Jesus was describing the heart of a Kingdom person through the eyes of a child… a Kingdom Kid!

            Kids trust… Kids believe the impossible… kids will love without reservation… However, the culture in which we live continues to take that away, piece by piece. Here at The Well, we want to invest in our kids. We want their future to be full of promise… and in order to get there, they must start now!
            <br>
            <br>
            When your child comes to a service at the Well, we will do everything in our power to make sure that they have an incredible time with other kids. We will teach them the Word of God in such a way that they will be able to understand it. We want them to be able to worship in a service that is designed for them with them in mind! Most importantly, we want them and their families to know that it is our first priority to make sure that they are protected in every way.

            Come join us at our 10am service… we would love to see you!
