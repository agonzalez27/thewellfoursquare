And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matt. 28:19-20)            <br>            <br>            How will we be able to go if we don’t know what we are talking about? In our Bible studies, we journey through books of the Bible or Scriptural topics much like a series. We learn in such a way that will allow us to understand and apply what God is saying to us personally, as well as how it relates to the world in which we live on a daily basis.            <br>            <br>            When we think of growth, we will tend to look at what is visible. Much like a tree, we admire the height of a tree… the thickness of its branches… the amount of fruit that is hanging on the limbs. However, what we often do not realize is that each of those things that we see is dependent upon the strength of the root system. Roots give nutrition, but they also will help to keep the tree upright in the midst of the storm.            <br>            <br>            Come and be a part of Roots. You will learn a great deal about God’s Word… and you will gain a lot of strength to stand when the storms come your way.          </p>       </span>     </div>   </div> </div>
