This application was coded using the MEAN Stack - MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js.

###YouTube Live
Using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), I set up live streaming for the church's services on Sunday morning.

###YouTube Data API
Using the YouTube Data API, the media page gets populated with all of the videos currently on the church YouTube page.

###Nodemailer
Using nodemailer, users are able to submit a prayer request to the prayer team directly from the home page.

##Design Work
###Logos
Using photoshop I designed the logos for Kingdom Kids, Elements Youth, and the Roots Bible Study.

###MaterializeCSS
I used MaterializeCSS rather than bootstrap to make the site mobile responsive.

###Digital Photography
I used a Canon T3i to take the picture of the church facade.

##Online Giving
###Easy Tithe
I helped set the church up with an easy tithe account so that members can make online donations.
